For the problem domain, I suggest a **Simple Order Management Dashboard**. This is a classic backoffice application that maps perfectly to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete orders) and is highly relevant to industrial/business contexts.

Here is the proposed step-by-step plan to create the course:

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Scaffolding (The Blueprint)**

This phase is about preparing the core assets. Completing this first ensures the content creation in Phase 2 is smooth and focused.

1.  **Define Core Application & Mock API:**
    * **Task:** Finalize the features for the "Order Management Dashboard" and define the data structure (e.g., `Order` interface with `id`, `customerName`, `status`, `amount`).
    * **Action:** Create a simple Node.js/Express server that serves this static data from a JSON file. It must provide REST endpoints for all CRUD operations (`GET /orders`, `GET /orders/:id`, `POST /orders`, `PUT /orders/:id`, `DELETE /orders/:id`).

2.  **Create the Starter Project:**
    * **Task:** Develop the initial Angular application that participants will receive.
    * **Action:** Generate a new Angular 20+ project using the CLI. Create the basic layout (header, main content area, footer) as standalone components. Add placeholder services and basic styling. This project should compile and run but have no real functionality yet. The goal is to eliminate boilerplate setup during the bootcamp.

### **Phase 2: Curriculum & Content Creation (The Build)**

With the project ready, we'll build the learning materials in a logical sequence. Each module will have a theory part (slides) and a practical part (lab guide).

3.  **Develop Module 1: Angular & TypeScript Fundamentals:**
    * **Task:** Create content for the initial introduction.
    * **Slides:** Cover TypeScript essentials (types, interfaces, classes), Angular CLI basics, and the structure of a standalone component.
    * **Lab:** Participants will explore the starter project, identify the main components, and make minor HTML/CSS changes to get comfortable with the environment.

4.  **Develop Module 2: Component-Driven UI with Signals:**
    * **Task:** Build the core lesson on reactive state management.
    * **Slides:** Introduce signals (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`), the new control flow (`@if`, `@for`), and event handling. Contrast this with older methods to highlight the benefits.
    * **Lab:** Participants will implement the "Read" part of CRUD. They will fetch the list of orders from the mock API and display it in a component using a signal and the `@for` block.

5.  **Develop Module 3: Component Interaction & State Updates:**
    * **Task:** Teach how to modify state and handle user input.
    * **Slides:** Explain signal updates (`set`, `update`), `input()` signals for passing data down, and the `output()` function for emitting events up.
    * **Lab:** Participants will build the "Delete" functionality. They'll create a "delete" button for each order which, when clicked, calls a method in the component to update the state and the API.

6.  **Develop Module 4: Reactive Forms for Data Entry:**
    * **Task:** Create the content for building robust forms.
    * **Slides:** Introduce the fundamentals of Reactive Forms (`FormGroup`, `FormControl`) and how to bind them to a signal-driven component state. Cover basic validation.
    * **Lab:** Participants will build the "Create" and "Update" functionality using a single form component. This form will be used to add new orders and edit existing ones.

7.  **Develop Module 5: Services & Dependency Injection (Briefly):**
    * **Task:** Explain how to properly structure data access logic.
    * **Slides:** Cover the role of services, singleton instances (`providedIn: 'root'`), and using the modern `inject()` function to provide services to components. Briefly touch upon routing as a concept for structuring larger applications.
    * **Lab:** Participants will refactor their HTTP logic out of their components and into a dedicated `OrderService`.

### **Phase 3: Finalization & Review (The Polish)**

This final phase ensures all materials are cohesive, correct, and ready for delivery.

8.  **Internal Dry Run & Review:**
    * **Task:** Validate the entire course flow and materials.
    * **Action:** Step through all slides and complete every lab exercise from the perspective of a beginner. Time each section, check for typos, and ensure the instructions are unambiguous. Refine the starter project and mock API based on any issues found.

9.  **Prepare Course Environment:**
    * **Task:** Set up the technical environment for both on-site and remote participants.
    * **Action:** Package the starter project and mock backend into a simple ZIP file or Git repository. Write clear, step-by-step setup instructions. Ensure the necessary software (Node.js, IDEs, Git) is confirmed on all course PCs.

Once these steps are completed, we will have a robust, modern, and highly practical Angular 20 bootcamp ready for delivery. Shall we proceed with Phase 1?
